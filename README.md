# Tweeter Project

**Tweeter** is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

Users are able to write and post tweets with a character limit of 140. They are generated with a name, username, and avatar and displayed on the webpage along with other past tweets.

## Final Product

This is what the homepage of Tweeter looks like on a desktop. The user's name and avatar are shown on the left. The tweets and form to write a new tweet are on the right.

You can write a new tweet and see how many characters you have left. The tweet button allows you to post it to the feed.

You can hover over the tweets and the flag, retweet, and like icons in the tweet box.

An error message slides down when you have not written anything or if you have exceeded the character limit.
